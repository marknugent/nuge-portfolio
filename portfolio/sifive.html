            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
              The market for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core">CPU cores</a> is dominated by Intel in traditional PCs and servers, and ARM in smartphones and specialized applications such as embedded processors. SiFive, a startup semiconductor company, challenges the Intel-ARM duopoly with the open-source RISC-V instruction set architecture.
            </p>
            <!--p>
              SiFive's founders had invented RISC-V as a research project at Berkeley. At the same time, they also developed <a href="https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip">new methods</a> for automating the configuration and generation of CPU core IP. (In silicon land, "IP," for "intellectual property," refers to the design of a chip's component in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">specialized language</a>, which precedes than the physical layout of circuits.) SiFive's new technology enables the creation of unique cloud-based products for core IP and microchip design.

            <p>
              When I began work at SiFive as their first (and so far, only) product designer, I was put to work on their planned SaaS products: Core Designer, for configuring CPU cores (the part of a microchip that does general computing tasks), and Chip Designer, for configuring and designing finished microchips, which normally integrate one or more CPU cores as well as various other functional blocks.

            <h4>Designing Core Designer</h4>

            <p>
              After extensive discussions with CPU design engineers, prospective users, and other stakeholders, I created a set of proto-personas representing our target users, and then began work on UI concepts. Because it is a farily unique product, I needed to solve some interesting problems due to constraints relating to CPU design generally and our technology in particular.
            </p>
            <a class="portdetail-body--image" href="/images/port-page-img/scd-med-fi-zoom@2x.png" data-lightbox="rom" data-title="Medium-fidelity design">
              <img src="/images/port-page-img/scd-med-fi.png" srcset="/images/port-page-img/scd-med-fi@2x.png 1074w, /images/port-page-img/scd-med-fi.png 537w" width="537" alt="Core Designer Current Start Page">
            </a>
            <p>The general pattern is that users choose a standard design as a starting point, which is populated with default values, and then add values and adjust settings as they desire. They can then generate and download a development kit for their core which contains a representation of the core in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">code</a> that canÂ can be integrated into various simulation and development tools.
            </p>
            <p>With Core Designer, we aim to allow users to quickly iterate and experiment with CPU core designs in a way that is not possible in the current industry model, where customers might be limited to a vendor&rsquo;s off-the-shelf cores, or at best, work with salespeople to get customized cores prepared by engineers &mdash; a time-consuming and expensive process.
            </p>
            <p>Initially, I sketched UI ideas on paper and used Balsamiq to create wireframes. I settled upon using a tabbed interface for the main UI, with related settings grouped together in tabs.
            </p>
            <p>When consensus had formed around basic UI patterns, I wanted to create a mockup with enough fidelity to be plausible as a real UI, so I created a set of medium-fidelity mockups using Sketch. I also created a number of clickable prototypes using InVision and later Figma, using these to gather feedback and conduct hallway usability testing.

            <p>
              Before the launch of Core Designer, SiFive had engaged with a design firm to create SiFive's new brand style and website. In consultation with the design firm, the visual design of Core Designer was adjusted to adopt the website's visual style. For example, the "start page" shown here uses signature graphics that the design firm had created to give each of our CPU cores a unique graphic identity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Core Designer launched in late 2018 and is used internally at SiFive and at companies such as Intel and Qualcomm. Not only a revenue-generating product in its own right, Core Designer is also employed in our sales process, allowing prospective customers to quickly spec out and generate CPU cores for evaluation.

            <p>
             Following the launch, we have steadily added features and enhanced the Core Designer UI. I also began using Figma as a design and collaboration tool. Pictured here is a detail from a set of mockups I prepared to advocate for the addition of a range slider to the UI, and also to describe its behavior for the developer who subsequently implemented it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also have acted as a member of the development team, having learned enough about our codebase, Django, React, and Styled Components to implement some UI enhancements and fixes without involving other developers, save for the pull-request stage.

            <h4>Core Designer Refreshed UI</h4>

            <p>
              We probably followed the styling of the website a bit <em>too</em> closely in Core Designer, because the current styling has some drawbacks, such as poor contrast, low information density, overuse of bright brand colors in the block diagram, and other issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've included a mockup produced as part of a design refresh project which attempts to resolve some of the drawbacks of the current design while retaining the essence of the brand style.

            <h4>Chip Designer</h4>
            <p>
              Chip Designer is an ambitious product, not yet launched, that will allow its users to create customized microchips through a cloud-based application.
            </p>
            <p>As with Core Designer, I began with sketches on paper and then created wireframes in Balsamiq in collaborative process.  </p>

            <p>
              I designed the main UI (shown in the image with the "El Camino Real" header) to follow a similar pattern of applications such as XCode and Keynote, with a main canvas in the center showing a chip&rsquo;s block diagram as the "document," and a properties panel on the right. However, Chip Designer differs from those applications in that a left panel is used to show a library of IP blocks that are available to include on the chip, whereas apps like XCode and Keynote use this area for navigation through the document or project.
            </a>
            <p>
              The properties area initially shows general information about the chip, but when a particular IP block on the chip is selected, the properties area updates with settings and properties for the selected IP.
            </p>
            <a class="portdetail-body--image portdetail-body--image" href="/images/port-page-img/SChD-zoom@2x.png" data-lightbox="rom" data-title="Chip Designer UI">
              <img src="/images/port-page-img/ChD-home.png" srcset="/images/port-page-img/ChD-home@2x.png 1066w, /images/port-page-img/ChD-home.png 533w" width="533" alt="Chip Designer UI" />
            </a>
            <p>
              The "Area Inspector" shown in the final image is a concept for a little utility, revealed in a modal pop-up, that gives a detailed view of how much space various IP blocks are taking up on a chip. Managing the area budget is one of the more important aspects of SoC (system-on-chip) design. The pattern is borrowed from operating system utilities for managing hard drive space.
            </p>
